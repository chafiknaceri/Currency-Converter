# Currency-Converter
<h1>Mobile App that converts any currency to another currency</h1>

I have Used the Free Converter API https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/ it is not perfect because i used  the free Version does not have unlimited requests per hour meaning when i have requested alot of times it would not get a result until the next hour due to the api constraints. But The app Can change between any Currency and there is also a switch button in the middle that changes the conversion from the FROM and the TO. My Feature That i have added more to the Test is the abilty to switch between two currencies in just one click.

The app Functionalty :<br />
<ol>
  <li> Enter Amount to Convert</li>
<li> Choose Starting Currency</li>
<li> Choose End Currency That you would want to Convert To</li>
<li> All Currencies Have Flags and currency,id and Name</li>
<li> Date of the retrieved data if i had the Paid API i could of made the conversions every 30 Seconds on its Own</li>
<li> One Click Button to Switch the Starting currency with the ending Currency</li>
</ol>

Key Improvements : 
Mainly to look perfect on all device sizes is something i could make better.
